# Clock

I am a Make School summer academy student, learning Swift and iOS app development. This was a project in which we had to fix the clock to make it display the current time with the correct degrees for the hour, minute, and second hands. At first, all three hands pointed toward the number 12. I successfully fixed the issue.
